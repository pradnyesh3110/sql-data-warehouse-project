SQL Data Warehouse Project
A comprehensive guide to building a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, encompassing ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.​

 
 
 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of constructing a data warehouse, from data ingestion to generating actionable insights. It adheres to industry best practices in data engineering and analytics, making it an excellent portfolio piece for:​


SQL Developers

Data Engineers

ETL Pipeline Developers

Data Architects

Data Analysts​


 Data Architecture
The architecture follows the Medallion Architecture pattern, comprising three layers:​


Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from source systems (e.g., CSV files).

Silver Layer: Data cleansing, transformation, and normalization.

Gold Layer: Business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.​


 ETL Process
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is designed to:​


Extract: Gather data from multiple sources, including ERP and CRM systems.

Transform: Cleanse and standardize data to ensure quality and consistency.

Load: Populate the data warehouse, structuring data into fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.​


 Analytics & Reporting
Utilizing SQL-based queries to derive insights on:​


Customer behavior and segmentation

Product performance metrics

Sales trends and forecasting​
